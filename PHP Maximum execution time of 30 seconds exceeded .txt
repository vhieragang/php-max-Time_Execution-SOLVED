My problem is Solved. i was using the wamp server and i did the following

I browse to C:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.2.8\bin\php.ini

Find:
post_max_size = 8M
upload_max_filesize = 2M
max_execution_time = 30
max_input_time = 60
memory_limit = 8M

Change to:
post_max_size = 750M
upload_max_filesize = 750M
max_execution_time = 5000
max_input_time = 5000
memory_limit = 1000M

Then restart wamp to take effect

After that it intalled successfully.

thank you again for giving me the clue "it is not a jSeblod problem, and for giving the variable (max_execution_time)"
